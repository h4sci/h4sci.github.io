                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 pb-4">
                    Git is the de facto standard when it comes to managing source code.
                    Almost all software development teams use git in some form or another.
                    Yet, git is not always intuitive and to reach a level of git proficiency that
                    makes a collaborator fit into teams requires practice.

                    The goal of this video series is to motivate and guide the listener's training.
                    The largest git platforms are worth billions of dollars even though large chunks
                    of the source code they host are publicly available to anyone.
                    The enormous amount of public git repositories does not only provide free software to
                    the endusers and inspiration to developers - it's a lake of information for AI tools
                    from GitHub Co-Pilot to Claude and beyond.
