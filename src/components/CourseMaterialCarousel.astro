	Information is ubiquitous. Time to practice, commitment and endurance is limited and has opportunity costs.
	Everyone has a different starting point, we all learn differently - particularly in a course where students from many fields come together.
    Hacking for Science aims to provide comfortable entry points to a wide variety of people who are interested in programming with data.
